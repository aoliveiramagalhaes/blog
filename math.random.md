## what is Math.random()?

The random() method returns a random number that isnâ€™t a whole number from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive).

To get it to be a whole number, i.e. an integer, apply `<Math.floor>`, which rounds down to the nearest whole number or `<Math.ceil>`, which rounds up to the nearest 
whole number.
  
**Example 1:**

Return a random number between 1 and 10:

```javascript

Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);

```
Since we actually wanted numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive, we added 1.

**Example 2:**

Return a random number between 0 and 10:

```javascript

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11))

``

Please note that `<Math.floor>` rounds down to the nearest whole number. 

If the random number is 9.9, `<Math.floor>` will round it to 9, so you will never get 10.

If you want the number 10, you need to write 11 in your code. It's always += 1.

**Note**

*Math.random() does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do not use them for anything related to security. 
Use the Web Crypto API instead, and more precisely the window.crypto.getRandomValues() method.*
